Regex, or regular expressions, are collections of characters that produce text search patterns. Used most frequently in word processors, text editors, and search engines. You may find a thorough description of a specific regex, one that looks for hexadecimals, here. A letter-and-whole-number value scheme is used in hexadecimals. Hex can be difficult to find because they frequently start with a # and have different numbers of characters.

Summary
The REGEX we will be discussing is a Matching Email expression. We will deconstruct this following statement : /^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/.

To ensure that a user inputs an email address that starts with an arbitrary amount of characters before the @ symbol, followed by a domain, each element of this regex has a specific duty.

We will identify the Anchors, Quantifiers,The OR Operator, Charecter Classes, Grouping and Capturing, Bracket expressions, Greedy and Lazy Match, Boundaries, Back-references, Flags and Look-ahead and Look-behind.

Regex Components
Anchors
As researched, Regex 'Anchors' are elements, or tokens, that are known to not match any characters. On the contrary, they are known to create relationships between strings and other related processes. Further, they reserve currently determined locations for strings, whether it be at the beginning or at the end of a string.

I am a full-time radiology scheduler for scheduling and am learning how to code in Rutgers Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. I am new to coding, but thought it was cool and wanted to have a change in career and decided to study in it. My goal is to be a web developer and better my skills even after graduating the bootcamp. On my free time, I enjoy working out, hanging out with my family and friends, and gaming.
